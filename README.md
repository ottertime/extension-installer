# Quackatime Installer

This script setups a WakaTime config file and installs editor extensions, so you can get started with Quackatime with one command!

## Supported IDEs

This installer has support for the following editors/IDEs:

- All JetBrains IDEs (e.g. IntelliJ, RubyMine)
- VSCode
  - Includes forks, such as Cursor, Windsurf, and Trae

If your IDE isn't on this list, that's okay! This script will write the required WakaTime config for you, which you can use to follow the instructions for [setting up other editors.](https://wakatime.com/help/editors)
